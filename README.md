# Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data
Data Analysis Professional Track - First project

## Overview
In this project, we will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. We will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.


## Computed statistics:
### 1) Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

- Most common month
- Most common day of week
- Most common hour of day
### 2) Popular stations and trip

- Most common start station
- Most common end station
- Most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)
### 3) Trip duration

- Total travel time
- Average travel time
### 4) User info

- Counts of each user type
- Counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
- Earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
